        I've always held a keen interest in health and exercise. More so after ill health
        cutailed my progress in proffesional swimming. Since i've tried a myriad of borderline
        crazy stuff - like going on a raw food diet for three years to deal with a skin issue - it worked.
        <br><br>
        The expeience was nothing short of enlightning. After suffering through the first three months of withdrawal. it's kind of a human reset button.
        We are what we eat. That said, I'm a big fan of greasy food.

        I did a certificate course in IT after high school at KCA.

        Up until then I'd gone through and completed the 8-4-4 system and the paper work that comes with it - read
